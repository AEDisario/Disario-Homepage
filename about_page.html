					<p> Disario is founded with the aim of offering a really good product. More than fashion we're into product design. Therefore we first patiently search for the best available materials, which we find mostly in Italy. In this search we concentrate on the touch of the fabric for all our clothes and accessoires. 
					<br>
					<br>

All other details of our products are also carefully considered, from the zips of our jackets to the buckles of our belts, to even the stitches on the collars of our T-shirts. This process takes time and as a result we will only slowly add products to our collection. By deeply caring about the product we hope this is experienced by the person wearing it. 
					<br>
					<br>
					
Our designs are contemporary interpretations of classical items, easily adaptable to many occassions. Essential in all our design are the proportions of the garment, offering a comfortable yet stylish option to wear. We really hope to simplify dressing. Not just today, but for the years to come.
